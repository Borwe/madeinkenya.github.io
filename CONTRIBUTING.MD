# Made in Kenya Contribution Guidelines

## Contributing a Project

To add a new project to the collection, please ensure they meet the following requirements arranged in order of importance

* The project must be Made in Kenya or Made by a Kenyan.

* The project must be open source.

* The project must have global use - meaning it's not made just for use by Kenyans and there really is no geographical limitation for anyone that may be interested in using the project.

* The project should have at least 10 stars (not so strict but preferred). This is just to help determine if the project is actually useful to humans (and/or aliens). Though we're sure you'll get more stars after listing it here for all to see.

* Be sure to provide a social media URL of the creator(s)/maintainer(s) of the project outside GitHub.

* Add the project to it's appropriate language section in an alphabetical fashion.
